SSH Hammer
==========
It's a tool that helps people in China using the internet freely. This does **not** work
in Windows since it has `pexpect` as a dependency.

Dependencies
------------
* Python 3.4
* pexpect
* ssh

Install
-------

    sudo python setup.py install

Usage
-----
Before the first time you run the `sshammer` script, copy `sshammer-config` to `~/.sshammer`
and then modify the `user` and `passwd` fields to correct value.

Once the configuration file is created, you can run the `sshammer/sshammer` script.
You can also run it as a module by:

    python -m sshammer

When started, this act as a SOCKS5 server on local port 7070. Then you can use it as a proxy.
